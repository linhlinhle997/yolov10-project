# YOLOv10 Object Detection
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for setting up and using the YOLOv10 model for object detection tasks. The repository is divided into two main parts:

1. **Setup and Usage of Pre-trained YOLOv10 Model**
2. **Training YOLOv10 on a Helmet Safety Detection dataset**

## Installation
To run the notebooks in Google Colab, follow these steps:
1. **Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)**
2. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   !git clone https://github.com/linhlinhle997/yolov10-project.git
   cd yolov10-project
   ```
3. **Google Colab setup**
- Ensure your Google Colab environment has GPU enabled
- Install necessary packages within the Colab notebook

## Usage
1. **Setup and Usage of Pre-trained YOLOv10 Model**
- Open the `yolov10_setup_and_usage.ipynb` notebook
- Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to set up the environment and use the pre-trained model
2. **Training YOLOv10 on a Helmet Safety Detection dataset**
- Open the `yolov10_helmet_safety.ipynb` notebook
- Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to fine-tune the YOLOv10 model on a Helmet Safety Detection dataset
